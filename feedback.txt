according to me what all i learnt in just a couple of hours i might have taken days to learn it from myself.
thanks alot to vinayan ....he made this all seem so simple and would like to thank sameer and shibin for giving us this opportunity.
and yes "MAGIC HAPPENED".
we were taught so nicely that it will be very hard to not develop interest in GIT.
thanks again thanks a lot
